# CPU - Constructor Protector Uniter

A game I'm writing to learn Scala.

Uses JMonkeyEngine3, which uses LWJGL.

Mostly I just wanted to write a Sparse Voxel Octree, then wrote a
renderer and realised that I was pretty much halfway to a Minecraft clone.

The idea is for it to be a cross between Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft -
you give commands to your robot peons but can also assume direct control if you want to build or fight yourself.
Ideally not as cumbersome as DF but with more gameplay than MC.

Setting will be post human/robot war, none of that generic fantasy rubbish thank you very much.

## Spitballing long-term ideas:
Different robots are specialised for different things, do you keep
the artisan/non-practical ones or do you keep the oil-lines pure?
What would multiplayer be like? Raids on each other's maps?
You are a paralysed robot (just a head?) that can have a large throne built around it in order to control more minions.
